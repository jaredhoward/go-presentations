Go Presentations
================

This includes the Go presentations that I've done.

## Using the Go present tool:

These presentations are intended to be ran through the Go present tool.

```
https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present
https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
```

### Installing the present tool

```
go get golang.org/x/tools/present
go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
```

### Running the present tool

Your current working directory should be this repository.
Then run:

```
$GOPATH/bin/present
```
